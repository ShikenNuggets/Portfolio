Hi! I’m Carter Rennick, and I’m a programmer from Toronto, Canada that specializes in game development in C++.

I’ve loved video games for as long as I can remember, and I’ve loved making them for over 10 years. This passion led me to a Game Programming education at Humber College, and my career as a C++ programmer at Gameloft.

I’m at my best when I’m working in C++, especially on custom game engines such as the proprietary one used by Disney Magic Kingdoms, my Capstone Project at Humber College, and another personal project I’ve been toying with more recently. I’ve developed a knack for graphics programming, implementing major features such as skeletal animation and shadow mapping (old school – raytraced shadows coming soon™) from scratch, but I have interest in all areas of game engine development.

I love superhero games such as Batman Arkham series and Spider-Man, third-person action RPGs like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, first person shooters like DOOM Eternal, and co-op games like Helldivers 2. Sometimes I like to push games to their absolute limit and beat them as quickly as possible, abusing any exploits I can find along the way. Other times I like to take it slow, enjoy the scenery and craftsmanship put into the game, and just generally have a good time. I enjoy studying the game design in any game I play, and I also enjoy pixel-peeping all the graphical goodness in the newest games. I have a deep respect for the people who make the engines/tools that are used to make these games, and that’s where I want to be.
