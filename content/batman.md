This is a game I made using the Unity Game Engine for a second semester course at Humber College. This, along with all my other work, got me a 98% overall final mark for the course. The project took about 3 months, starting January 26th and ending April 27th, 2017.

The goal of this project was to recreate an NES game inside of Unity. I chose the 1989 Batman game by Sunsoft. All the artwork was taken from the original game, and the level is a loose recreation of the first level of the original game.

You can [download and play the game here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30GLRJb0Ng2VjhwMzB6TEdDRFU).
