This is a game I made in C# for a first semester course at Humber College. This, along with all my other work, got me an 86% overall final mark for the course. The project took about two weeks, starting November 9th and ending November 21st, 2016.

Itâ€™s a pretty simple Battleship style game. You choose the coordinates you want to fire at, and the game will redraw the grid, either with an X or an O in that position. X means you hit a ship, O means there was nothing there. The game ends if you destroy all the ships or run out of shots.

You can [download the game off my Google Drive and play it yourself](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30GLRJb0Ng2RDdvOFNXeU5yWXM). Enjoy!
