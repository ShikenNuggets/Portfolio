**Role:** Unreal Engine Software Developer
**Team:** [Clay Software Corporation](https://www.launchclay.com/)
**Type:** ArchViz
**Timeline:** Oct 2024 - Present
**Tech:** UE5 / C++ / Git

Primary Responsibilities:
* Architected and maintained standardized C++ plugins used by over a dozen architecture visualization projects, allowing new features and bug fixes to be rolled out more easily and consistently.
* Built custom editor utilities and C++ automation tools to procedurally generate 3D environments based on client-provided 2D floorplans, significantly reducing initial setup time for new projects.
* Designed a self-serve customization system to allow clients to directly modify lighting, materials, and furniture in our 3D environments, without needing to use finite art team resources or rebuild/redeploy applications.
* Created a highly intuitive player navigation system for exploring the digital twins, designed to require minimal setup per-project, and be accessible and easy to learn for users with no real-time video game experience.
* Consolidated disparate prototype functionality from Unreal blueprints into organized, performant, and production-ready C++ code.
* Integrated data tracking functionality to give our clients insight into how users interact with the digital twins.
* Optimized RAM, GPU usage, and initial load times to ensure smooth operation in our cloud-based environment.
* Maintained and administered git repositories for Unreal Engine projects and plugins, balancing storage and egress costs with ease of use for our art team.
