My primary responsibilities on DMK included:
* Implementing data tracking functionality in C++ for the iOS version.
* Ensured tracking was done correctly and on-schedule for over 50 major updates and dozens of hotfixes.
* Coordinated with the Features team to anticipate tracking work for new features.
* Coordinated with our business intelligence team, customer care agents, and other data clients to ensure our tracking implementation met their needs.
* Worked with all teams to ensure that tracking for all new features and content was carefully planned, and not just an afterthought.
* Found ways to optimize the amount of data we track while still meeting the needs of our data clients.
* Debugged various issues throughout the codebase, including 10+ year old legacy code.
* Integrated new external libraries into our game, and updated existing ones.

Additionally, there was also an effort to port the game to Unity/C#, although this was not completed. I worked on that for about a year while continuing to work on the C++ version of the game. In that time, I:
* Implemented data tracking functionality (some code was directly ported, much was rewritten), and improved Gameloftâ€™s C# tracking SDK.
* Helped implement new back-end code for the options menu UI.
* Helped implement and debug anti-hack features.
