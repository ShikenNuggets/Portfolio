**Team:** Solo
**Type:** Tabletop-Style Game (Educational)
**Timeline:** December 2017 – January 2018 (1 month)
**Tech:** Java

This is a game I made with a group for a second semester Java course at Humber College. This, along with all my other work, got me a 90% overall final mark for the course. The project took about a month, though it was built on a previously made text-based chess game for the first few assignments in the course.

The goal of this project was to take our text-based chess game and give it a GUI. This required us to restructure our project somewhat, but otherwise the basic functionality remained the same, and the main focus was on the GUI.

You can [download and play the game from here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UmB_C3Y8VAwBG-i754tlfC-Jd1plEXx2). It’s worth noting that the game doesn’t have a win condition, as this was not a requirement for the project.
