**Type:** 2D Fighting Game (Educational)
**Timeline:** March 2017 – April 2017 (3 weeks)
**Tech:** JavaScript / HTML5

This is a JavaScript game I made with a group for our Online Gaming 2 class. This along with the rest of my work for the course got me a 99% overall final mark. The project took about 3 weeks, starting March 27th and ending April 18th.

The goal was to make a simplistic recreation of Street Fighter in JavaScript. The game needed to be playable as both a multiplayer game and as a singleplayer game with basic AI. This admittedly isn’t my best work, but I still felt that it was worth including.
