**Team:** Solo
**Type:** 2D Physics Puzzle Game (Educational)
**Timeline:** March – April 2017 (3 weeks)
**Tech:** C++

This is a game I made in C++ as part of my Game Dynamics class. This project along with the rest of my work for the class scored me a 95% overall final mark for the course. The goal of this project was to create a simple game, similar to Peggle. The primary focus was to simulate the gravity and motion physics on the balls, as well as testing and resolving collisions between them. The project took a little under a month, starting March 30th and ending April 18th, but it was built on top of previous projects in the course.

You can [download and play the game here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30GLRJb0Ng2akMxQUFtbmxRa0k).

You can also [download the source code here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30GLRJb0Ng2YjJSZUtaSGEybmM). Anything in the ‘Math’ folder there was provided by the professor, but the rest was written by me.
