**Type:** Game Engine + 3D Platformer (Educational)
**Timeline:** September 2017 – April 2019 (1.5 year)
**Primary Role:** Lead Engine Programmer / Project Manager
**Tech:** C++ / OpenGL / Git

As my Capstone Project for my Game Programming education at Humber College, I worked with three other students to create a custom game engine, called the *PizzaBox Game Engine*. We then used this engine to create a 3D physics-based platformer called *Roof Toppers*. My work on this project got me 99% in the Capstone course, and I ended my Game Programming Advanced Diploma with a 90.65 GPA.

When we originally started creating the engine, we weren’t entirely sure what kind of game we were going to make with it, so we tried to do things as generically as possible to allow us to theoretically to make any kind of game. A lot of our high-level architecture decisions were based on Unity due to our familiarity with it.

*PizzaBox* features a ton of essential components for any game engine, such as 3D rendering with OpenGL, a rudimentary UI system, skeletal animation, 3D audio with FMOD, physics with collision detection and response with ReactPhysics, input from keyboard, mouse, and gamepads with SDL2, a custom math library, resource management, and run-time gameplay script parsing with Lua (Lua support was completed fairly late in production, so we didn’t end up using it for *Roof Toppers*).

I was the Lead Programmer for *PizzaBox*, and served as the Project Manager for *Roof Toppers*. I ensured that tasks were completed on schedule with tight deadlines, and I maintained the code repository so that code quality and efficiency standards were met. I was responsible for a many of the engine features, including the resource manager, integrating FMOD, our skeletal animation system, and Lua script parsing. I also helped other team members implement essential features like real-time shadows, UI, integrating the physics library, and gameplay for *Roof Toppers*.

*Roof Toppers* is a 3D physics-based platformer featuring a grappling hook that allows the player to swing across wide gaps. The game has a tutorial and two levels. We had plans for a third level where you climb up a sinking building, but due to time constraints and some unexpected technical issues we weren’t able to complete it.

*Roof Toppers* and the *PizzaBox* engine demo reel were showcased at Humber College’s *Capstone Showcase*, and the *Level Up Showcase* in April 2019.
