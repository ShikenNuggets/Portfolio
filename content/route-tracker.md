In early 2020, a new speedrunner in the Batman: Arkham community known as oneeyeddeacon was interested in running Arkham Knight's 100% speedrun category. Arkham Knight has many side missions and 243 collectibles that you must obtain in this speedrun. Due to the complexity of the run, and the route needing to change relatively often to be as fast as possible, it is somewhat difficult to memorize everything that you need to collect in the run. oneeyeddeacon devised a solution: a tool that would read the game's save data during your run to keep track of which collectibles and side missions you had completed, and display an itemized list in order of the things you still needed to do. The result was the 100% category becoming much more accessible, and much more based on your skill at performing the run than a measurement of how well you can memorize hundreds of individual requirements.

I became involved with the project in April 2020. oneeyeddeacon's original version of the tracker only worked for Arkham Knight, and he had created separate utilities for the other three games. I felt it would be worthwhile for all four games to be supported by the same tool, and there were some aspects of the original that I found to be lackluster. With his blessing, I formally took over the project and created the repository for the combined tool.

Development continued rapidly throughout 2020 and into 2021. Development has slowed down, with new updates only once or twice a year, but it is actively maintained and extensively used by the community.
