Type: Console Utility
Timeline: April 2020 - Oct 2021
Tech: C# / speedrun.com API

Very simple console utility that pulls speedrun data from the speedrun.com API and backs it up locally in spreadsheet files. For quite a while speedrun.com did not have granular backups - they were able to roll back the entire site, but if something went wrong with an individual leaderboard that community was on their own to recover lost data. I decided it would be useful to be able to back up data on my own and created this utility. I am unsure if others got much use out of it, but I still use it to this day, and my personal backups have been referenced on several occasions due to minor issues.

The bulk of the work was completed in a few weeks in April 2020, with minor revisions and features added. The last change to functionality was in October 2021, aside from updating dependencies to address security vulnerabilities it is not actively maintained.
