This is a game I made using the Unity Game Engine for a third semester course at Humber College. This, along with all my other work, got me a 99% overall final mark for the course,

The goal of this project was to create a 3D game inside of Unity. I chose to make a stealth game inspired by Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, and Perfect Dark.
