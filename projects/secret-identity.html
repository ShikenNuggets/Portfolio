            While I have kept up with Unreal Engine developments over the years and occasionally toyed with it here and there, it had been a while since I've properly sat down and tried to really make a game with it, so I figured it was high time to give it another go.
        
            <br>
            <br>

            Secret Identity is an idea I've had floating around in my head for as long as I can remember. The core concept - you choose what kind of superhero you want to be. Choose what superpowers you have, but also in the behavioral sense; Are you a true hero who avoids violence at all costs? A ruthless vigilante who shows no mercy? Somewhere in between? The choice is yours, but there will be consequences.

            <br>
            <br>

            Ultimately, my dreams for what this game could be are far too ambitious for a solo developer (and, frankly, probably too ambitious for most AAA development teams as well). However, I scaled back the scope of the idea to focus on just one type of hero. My choice: the "leaps tall buildings in a single bound" variety.

            <br>
            <br>
            The core gameplay loop I settled on is very arcade-style. As time goes on, more and more thugs spawn. Your goal is simply to hold off the tide for as long as you can. I had big dreams for where to take the concept from here; more crisis types (e.g. burning building, more specific crimes, alien scout attack, giant robot attack, full-on alien invasion, etc).

            <br>
            <br>

            I'm very happy with what I was able to accomplish in just 3 months, but ultimately my workflow was overcome by Unreal's hefty performance requirements, so I decided to focus on other aspects of my portfolio instead.

            <a href="https://github.com/ShikenNuggets/SecretIdentity">Code repository can be found here</a> (C++ code and project files only, does not contain game assets/content due to storage limitations). Playable builds of UE5 games are pretty huge, so unfortunately I have no way to distribute it.
